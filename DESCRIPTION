Description: Cross tabulation for HTML and Markdown. This packages offers
    cross tabulation in a new way: You can use the pipe-operator to create cross
    tabulation with a greater degree of complexity and customization.
    The resulting table is rendered as HTML, which is far more flexible than
    returning a table in the console. Methods for using crosstabr together with
    RMarkdown will be made available.
