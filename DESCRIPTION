Title: Cross Tabulation with HTML and R Markdown
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: person("Thomas", "Klebel", email = "t.klebel@icloud.com",
          role = c("cre", "aut"))
Description: Cross tabulation for HTML and R Markdown. This packages offers
    cross tabulation in a new way: You can use the pipe-operator to create cross
    tabulation with a greater degree of complexity and customization.
    The resulting table is rendered as HTML, which is far more flexible than
    returning a table in the console. Methods for using crosstabr together with
    R Markdown will be made available.
